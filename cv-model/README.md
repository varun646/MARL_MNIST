# CNN for Masked MNIST Classification

A general purpose CNN trained on MNIST images with masks applied to them to hide portions of the image

## Model Architecture

*Will add to this section once model architecture is defined*

## Dataset
- Custom torch vision dataset which applies various masks to MNIST data
- May leave unmasked images as well to improve model accuracy
- Custom masks and mask sizes applied at initialization
